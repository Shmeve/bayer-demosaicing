## Prequisits
- OpenCV
- C++ 11

- Make

## Compilation instructions

**This project uses the C++11 standard, and you will need a recent compiler capable of supporting these features.**

This project uses CMake >=3.5 (https://cmake.org/) to generate build files for any platform. It can be installed on Linux or macOS using a package manager, or Windows using the official installer. Ensure it is added to your system PATH and accessible via command line.

Then, CMake can be used in the command line to generate build files for any environment desired.

1. `cd [path to assignment]`
2. `mkdir build`
3. `cd build`
4. `cmake -G "your generator here" ..`
    - Run `cmake -G` to see a list of possible generators, eg. `Xcode`, `Unix Makefiles`, versions of Visual Studio, etc.
5. Build the project using whichever build system you chose.

## Results


## Notes
This assignment has been tested on Linux, using OpenCV 3.4.0, CMake 3.10.2, Make 4.2.1
